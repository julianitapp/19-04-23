<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the table we can see that the months that are in the regression line are
    increasing.
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots symbolizes the regression line, the kWh are symbolized with
    the red dots, we can also see that the red dots are nearer with the gray
    dots in the months 1,2,4, and 5; but in the month 3 we can see that there is
    a very big increasement with more than 20 kWh.
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = -5.20 \cdot 6 + 139.20 $$ $$ y = 108 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In the house we can reduce the kWh expeneses by making ourselves aware of
    the enviroment and leaving aside the use of electronic devices connected to
    energy for so long.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    The statistical datas that are in the regression line are in a continuos
    increase.
  </li>
  <li>
    All the red dots are near to the gray dots, except the families with 5
    members that have under 100 KhW more that the dots in the regression line,
    on average all the points are.
  </li>
  <li>
    $$ y = 69.92 \cdot 200 - 118.97 $$ $$ y = 13865.03 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    These two variables are correlated, because they have very near results but
    they doesnÂ´t have a diversion so the regression line is a diagonal straight.
  </li>
</ul>
