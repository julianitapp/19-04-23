    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
      <ul>
            <li>In the table it can be seen a strong negative correlation. The KWh decrease as the months go by.</li>
            <li>The red dots symbolizes the KWh and the grey dots symbolizes the regression line. The dots aren´t really close together, but the differences aren´t that bad. The closest are the ones that are in month number 2 with a difference of 0. 4 KWh, and the ones that are in month 4 are the fartest ones, with a difference of 8.8 KWh.</li>
            <li>$$ y = -2.20 \cdot 6 + 124.00 $$ $$ y = 137.2 $$</li>
            <li>I believe that in my house we are really responsible saving energy, but we can always improve, carrying out actions such as turning off the light when it is not necessary.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <ul>
         <li>There is a positive correlation in which the KWh increases at the same time that the residents increases.</li>
         <li>The closest dots are the ones that are representing the families with 3 residents, and the ones that represent the families with 7 residents are the fartest ones.</li>
         <li>$$ y = 29.77 \cdot 200 - 55.99 $$ $$ y = 5898.01 $$</li>
         <li>These two variables are correlated because they have very near results</li>
      </ul>
