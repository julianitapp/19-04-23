<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the table we can see that the months that are in the regression line are
    in decreasement.
  </li>
  <li>
    The gray dots symbolizes the regression line, the kWh are symbolized with
    the red dots, we can also see that the red dots are nearer with the gray
    dots in the months 1,2,4,and 5; but in the month 3 we can see that the kWh
    had the hightest point in the table and we can analyse that in this month
    the kWh increases around 8 points.
  </li>

  $$ y = -3.70 \cdot 6 + 141.90 $$ $$ y = 119.7 $$

  <li>
    The way to maintain the Kwh is to continue with the habits that are
    mantained, because in my house although we are almost never there, we are
    very aware of the expenses.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    The regression line stays in a straight line in comparison with the first
    graphic, we can only see a little decreasement in the kWh when the members
    of the family increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    When they are only 2 memebers in the family the red dots are very near to
    the gray dots, but when the members of the family increases to 3, the
    results are very away from the regression line dots. One family having more
    than 200 kWh and another family have 50 kWh so the differences are very big,
    and both are separated from the gray dots
  </li>
  $$ y = -12.89 \cdot 200 + 158.62 $$ $$ y = -2419.38 $$
  <li>
    These two variables are correlated because they have very near results but
    in this case it doesnÂ´t change the regression line, because the kWh have
    very high scores and very low ones in the same number of members (3)
    results.
  </li>
</ul>
